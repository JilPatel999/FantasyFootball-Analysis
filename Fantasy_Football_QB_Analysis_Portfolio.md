Executive Summary
This report presents a concise, portfolio-ready analysis of NFL quarterback performance over the last four seasons, with the goal of informing 2025 fantasy draft strategy. Using cleaned play-by-play and season-level statistics, I benchmark average QB fantasy PPG by year, compare rookies vs. non-rookies, and interpret a regression model to quantify which metrics most influence fantasy production. Key findings: (1) 2020 remains an outlier season with elevated scoring, (2) rookies are narrowing the performance gap vs. veterans when they log significant snaps, and (3) dual‑threat ability (rushing TDs and yards) materially increases fantasy PPG.
Average QB Fantasy PPG by Year (2020–2024)
Average PPG shows a decline from 2020 through 2023, followed by stabilization in the 16–17 PPG range. The 2020 season stands apart due to pandemic-era dynamics (abbreviated off‑season, reduced fan attendance), which diminished defensive cohesion and typical home‑field effects, boosting offensive efficiency.
Portfolio takeaway: Avoid over-weighting 2020 as a baseline when projecting 2025 values; use 2021–2024 as the primary reference window.
Rookies vs. Non‑Rookies
Non‑rookie QBs outscore rookies by a little over one point per game on average (min. 8 games played). However, the margin is tighter than expected. Recent examples (e.g., Jayden Daniels in 2024; C.J. Stroud in 2023) illustrate that NFL‑ready schemes, strong supporting casts, and designed rushing can accelerate rookie impact.
Portfolio takeaway: Rookies with starting volume and dual‑threat usage can be viable mid‑round values, monitor camp reports and scheme fit. Not always wise to waste a premier draft pick on veteran QBs. Waiting till later rounds to select a rookie-QB is a viable option.
Regression Coefficient Analysis
The model ranks statistic impact on fantasy PPG as follows (per‑unit effect, sign shows direction):
Rushing TDs (+0.414)
Passing TDs (+0.281)
Interceptions (−0.158)
Rushing Yards (+0.0062)
Completions (+0.021)
Pass Attempts (−0.017)
Passing Yards (+0.0001)
Rushing Attempts (−0.013)
Interpretation: Dual‑threat production is the largest positive driver of fantasy scoring. TDs matter most; volume without efficiency (high attempts with low completion and elevated INT risk) suppresses PPG.
Target Profiles & 2025 Watchlist
Optimal profile: mobile quarterbacks with designed rushing usage and red‑zone involvement, supported by efficient passing. Examples: Josh Allen, Lamar Jackson, Jayden Daniels (noting smaller sample size).
Portfolio takeaway: Prioritize dual‑threat QBs at a reasonable draft cost; build depth at WR/RB where replacement value is lower.
Model‑Based Top QB Recommendations
The regression‑based ranking aligns closely with consensus boards. Notably, some elite real‑world QBs may rank lower when their fantasy rushing contribution is limited or when TD variance trends down.
Appendix: Method & Notes
• Data scope: 2020–2024 regular seasons; QB records filtered to ≥8 games started/played where applicable.
• Features: passing/rushing volume and efficiency metrics; fantasy scoring in standard formats.
• Modeling: linear regression with standardized inputs; coefficients interpreted for directional impact.
• Limitations: 2020 season contextual anomaly; scheme/coach changes and injury context not fully captured.
